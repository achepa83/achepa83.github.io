                        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">Especially with a team of highly skilled people, it is important to leave everyone enough freedom and room to unlock their full potential. <br>I want to micromanage ideation and planning, but not everyones work. Strategy, vision and requirements need to be absolutely clear. <br><br> If everyone knows and understands the "why?" and the "what?" with absolute clarity, great people will take care of the individual "hows?" and specialities of their field at their best. <br>Every minute spent for planning and clarifying in the beginning, can safe hours and days during execution.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">Cross functional teams speak many different languages! <br><strong>BUT!</strong> Musicologists don't speak sales or marketing.

                        <div id="content"><h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
                            <p>Stretta had neglected the wind music market since the beginning of their journey. They came from classical music and lacked the expertise in this field. <br />
                            Wind music repertoire was badly to not at all curated in Stretta's database. <br />
                            On top of that, Stretta's process of curating content was intentionally random to make sure that also unpopular and niche content was constantly curated and found it's way into the shop.</p>
                            <h3 id="insight">Insight</h3>
                            <p>I knew that many wind orchestras easily spend 1.000€ and more for sheet music every year. There are around 16.000 wind bands in Germany alone, accounting for almost half of all ensembles in the country.</p>
                            <h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
                            <h4 id="step-1-fill-the-shop">1. Fill the shop... fast!</h4>
                            <p>Since we had another wind music expert in our team, I gave him the task to prepare the curation process, by collecting around 200 of the most important composers for wind music, and setting up new categories that conductors would like to quickly find, like: <br />
                            Film music, Musical, Concert, Symphonic, Traditional (German) Folk Music, March, Waltz, Classical Transcriptions, Winds &amp; Choir, Winds &amp; Narrator, Brass Band, Youth Orchestra, Fanfare...</p>
                            <p>Now the rest of the product maintenance team could start curating every piece for these composers, and assigned our new categories to them.<br />
                            We finished this process in about 8 weeks and had curated a few thousand wind music pieces, a good chunk of the top of the iceberg. <br /><br>
                            It would have taken years if not "forever" without this orchestrated two step effort.</p>
                            <h4 id="step-2-a-dedicated-portal-for-wind-music">2. Dedicated portal for wind music</h4>
                            <p>I had the idea to build a dedicated new portal for wind music with specialized filter categories and easy access to different ensemble types like "Youth Orchestra" or "Brass Band". <br />
                            Thinking like a conductor, I wanted to enable our customers to easily buy a whole new program of sheet music. A conductor may search for standards, easy works, some monumental concert works and every now and then something very special like a work with a choir or narrator.</p>
                            <h4 id="step-3-influencer">3. Get the best podcaster in the field</h4>
                            <p>At the same time I approached one of the most important podcaster in German speaking countries for wind music, and got him as our main influencer to talk about our new portal. His podcast was growing fast and his listeners where exclusively our exact target group of conductors and decision makers in this market segment. </p>

                            <p>I got the task to create a concept for a redesign of Stretta's frontpage. The old and very short version was lacking most of what you would expect from a commercial website:

                                    <li>Text over images as entry points is visually confusing</li>

                            <p>When Stretta moved into it's new, way bigger headquarter, in early 2021, my first task was to plan a multi-media production studio.</p>
                            <h3 id="the-plan">The plan</h3>
                            <p>I wanted to integrate a cozy lounge area that could be used for interviews. <br> I let part of the room be painted with a mid grey tone to have a neutral background, unpolluted light and to make colors pop in front of the background. <br><br> I planned the room to have areas for table top photography, a large backdrop that could be rolled out from the ceiling, a desk with an iMac for post production and daily office work, and of course enough space for storing equipment, tools, stands, cables and all the little things you need in a multi functional studio like this.<br><br>I also had to stay in a tight budget while still getting good results for professional use. </p>
                            <h3 id="side-effect">Side effect</h3>
                            <p>The cozy area was later also preferred by all our colleagues as a chill-out area and for chatting with visitors from publishing houses or Stretta friends.</p>

                            <p>Find a famous guy with a large following and some regular posts. Pay him a lot of of money and then expect him to do, ehm, something with your sheet music.<br />
                            Like, sitting at the pool in Buenos Aires and somehow praising your newest edition...</p>
                            
                            <p>This feels <strong style="font-weight: 600;">unnatural.</strong> It feels <strong style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.8rem;">awkward!</strong> It is <strong style="font-weight: 900; font-size: 2.2rem;">awkward!!</strong></p><br><br><br>
    
                            <h4>In sales we call it the Jones effect</h4><br>
                            <p> <i>"People are more likely to be influenced by the actions and choices of those they perceive as similar to themselves."</i> </p><br>
                            <p>It makes a company look like sitting in a very high, 300 years old ivory tower. Guess the company ;-) </p>
                            <p>Besides the costly unrelatability of such a choice, these types of "influencial people" are not professional content creators. This is a high-cost, low-outcome approach that, moreover, potentially damages how 'regular people' in the audience perceive a company.</p><br>

                            <p>I came up with the idea of building artist pages for Stretta's influencers on Stretta's website. <br> These pages are filled with recommendations of repertoire, etudes and favorite method books of the artist. An easy way for the artist to reference and link to that page. <br/>
                            A great way to direct traffic to Stretta from a highly trusted source, the artists themselves.</p><br>

                            It happens behind the curtains and in real life. A bunch of emails, pre-prepared content, "co-authored" posts. <br>
                            Or maybe: "We take pictures, we are happy to share them with you, let's do a cooperational post, like, comment and share each others content..."</p>

                            The largest part of this success may have been due to Corona. People obviously spent more time making music and therefore bought more sheet music. <br> But we contributed our share with a consistent flow of content on social media, in Stretta's blog "Stretta Journal" and through our newsletter.</p>

                            <p>While everyone is walking in the same direction, just break out, and move into a different direction...<br />
                            During my short time at Breitkopf I tried to bring up unusual ideas for very real problems.</p>
                            <h4 id="insight">Insight</h4>
                            <p>Breitkopf's CEO, Nick Pefferkorn, told me about the state of contemporary music nowadays. Most new pieces are barely played more than once at a premiere. Every concert house loves writing "Premiere" on top of their ads. But then the music disappears. That's a huge problem for publishing contemporary music!<br />
                            Our discussion about possible reasons went deeper than that. But let's stop here... </p>
                            <h4 id="idea">Idea</h4>
                            <p>We could challenge a musical mastermind of our time, that some even want to compare to Mozart, to write a symphony for grand orchestra! Jacob Collier!<br />
                            Jacob is keeping himself independent from brands and companies. But, so I thought, maybe we could "get" him with such a challenge, and because Breitkopf has such a sounding name. Chances where low, but I liked the idea and proposed it.</p>
                            <p>Nick just asked me: "Who is Jacob Collier?"</p>
                            <p>Hmmm. I still like the idea. Or I maybe just want to have a hangout and a little jam with Jacob Collier once in my life...</p>

                            <p>Breitkopf was about to release a new Urtext edition of Richard Strauss's "An Alpine Symphony". <br />
                            Nick Pfefferkorn himself was the editor. So I thought this could be a great opportunity do something special with viral potential for the global orchestra musicians community...</p>
                            <h3 id="insight">Insight</h3>
                            <p>I am an orchestra low brass player. I know how much brass players freak out about Strauss's Alpine Symphony. A good story and well produced images around a new release of this piece could have gone viral in this community. And through the brass players it could reach orchestras allover the world.</p>
                            <h3 id="idea">Idea</h3>
                            <p>Some of my former fellow students and friends are holding positions in Germanys finest orchestras. They founded "Salaputia Brass" about ten years ago. Salaputia gathers Germanys finest next generation of orchestra brass players. They can truly be compared to German Brass.<br />
                            I wanted to invite these guys to do a mountain tour in the alps and play an arrangement of "On the summit" on an actual summit. We would hire a small film team, get the hero shot on the mountain top with a drone orbiting the ensemble and make a beautiful video of this alpine happening. <br />
                            Besides that, we would produce a behind the scenes video, showing the "band of brothers", the planning and the exhausting tour to the summit, with all the instruments and equipment that need to be carried.</p>
                            <h3 id="possible-outcome">Possible outcome</h3>
                            <p>This could have been a viral hit, if produced well and seeded throughout platforms, magazines and blogs allover the world. You don't just post something like this on your own channels and wait for magic to happen. You need to actively boost and orchestrate such a release in advance.</p>
                            <p>It would have given Breitkopf a juvenile and adventurous attribute. Something that this 300 years old man urgently needs.</p>
                            <h3 id="costs">Costs</h3>
                            <p>I wanted to get the ensemble (almost) for free. We would just pay for the travel. A good two or three man film crew could be hired locally for a few thousand euros for two days. A good editor on top and we could have done this for around 10.000€.<br />
                            That's not a lot of money for a possible global impact in a highly focussed target group and an image refresh.<br />
                            The ensemble would have had a great trip and global marketing for free. It should have been a no brainer for them.</p>
                            <p>Nick actually loved the idea a lot. But, it never happened...</p>

                            <p>Musicologists are scientists. Besides some naturally talented individuals, they would almost always write scientific texts. They can argue for hours about the correct type of quotation marks. But their content often reads like a Wikipedia article. Names, places, dates, works and more names, places...</p>
                            <h3 id="i-had-to-nurture-my-team">I had to nurture my team</h3>
                            <p>My mission was clear. It was my job to enable my team to write better, more engaging content and copy. So I collected resources about blog structures, storytelling, how to write a report, a commentary and what type of language to use and not to use.<br />
                            I encouraged them to try new approaches and find their creative voice. It was about engaging a wide audience and not about impressing other experts out there.</p>
                            <h3 id="copy-guidelines-across-teams-and-touch-points">Copy guidelines across teams and touch points</h3>
                            <p>I quickly realized that Stretta needed a unified tone of voice for any kind of copy. Not just long form texts in Stretta's Journal. So I developed a set of simple guidelines to help streamline copy across any possible touch points: social media, customer service, newsletter, website system text, invoices...<br />
                            Guides like:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Use a simple, casual language</li>
                                    <li>Don't try to sound smart</li>
                                    <li>Keep it on eye level</li>
                                    <li>If you have to choose, use a simple word instead of a sophisticated word</li>
                                    <li>Keep most of your sentences short without  nesting</li>
                                    <li>Vary the length of your sentences</li>
                                    <li>Use "we" when you refer to Stretta more often</li>
                                    <li>Remember that the natural flow of a sentence is: subject, predicate, object (at least in German)</li>
                                    <li>Read your copy out loud! Does it sound natural to yourself?</li>
                                    <p style="margin-top: 0;">...</p>
                                </ul>
                            <p>Such simple recommendations can produce "in sum" a more unified tone that caters to a wider audience.</p>
                            <h3 id="finally">Finally</h3>
                            <p>This work payed off after a while. My proof reading was focussing more and more just on little typos. And I didn't have to work through a text or piece of copy anymore, and explain sentence by sentence how it might be better for the web...</p>
                            <p>One of my younger team members, who was still studying, told me later that his marks for his research papers got better, and that one of his professors noticed a change, for the better, in his writing. <br />
                            I liked that!</p>

                            <h3>Insight</h3>    
                            <p>People will always react to beloved composers and artists. But this emotional reaction comes from personal experiences with these composers and their music.<br />
                            It is not related to the company posting these covers.</p>
                            <h3>Goal</h3>
                            <p>I wanted to add new emotions to our product images. Emotions of coziness, familiarity and humanity. I wanted to show that we are not just a web shop, some URL on the internet. I wanted to show that we are people, handling and using sheet music every day. And I wanted to show the beauty and a haptic sense of well crafted sheet music.</p>
                            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                            <p>I found inspiration in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hugendubel/" target="_blank">Hugendubel's Instagram account</a>, a leading German bookstore, and tried to do something similarly creative.</p>
